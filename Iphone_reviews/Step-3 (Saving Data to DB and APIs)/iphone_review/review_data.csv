2,Blue," Another beauty from Apple. I was upgraded from iPhone X and it was great experience with all the latest specs and flawlessly smooth. Thanks to all new A14 Bionic chip.
Build quality was great as always from Apple.
Phone feels light on hands due to aluminium body. I chose Blue colour because wanted to go for different colour than routine Black and white iPhones so initially I was bit skeptical but after seeing the phone in person I‚Äôm happy with the blue colour ‚Äú not bad at all and not too flashy‚Äù
Grip and feel perfect. Phone comes with iOS 14.1. Camera quality was excellent and sufficient as a normal user.
If you are from iOS ecosystem nothing will go wrong here.
There is nothing to question about the quality and interface from Apple ( it‚Äôs my personal opinion as a long time apple user)
As you all know iPhone 12 won‚Äôt comes with earphones and charging brick( adapter)
I bought separately 20w apple adapter from new Apple India online store for Rs.1900
I don‚Äôt judge here apple because of accessories removal and the price tag. I hope apple can justify this.
I only hope and wanted to see so badly Made in India IPhones so that we all can enjoy lower priced ( at least a better priced) iPhones in the future.
A big thanks to Appario Retail Pvt. Ltd and Amazon for delivering genuine iPhone as always in perfect condition. Delivered way before the promised date.
Update: (01/12/2020) After testing 25 days especially on battery life of this iPhone 12, results were amazing and I‚Äôm completely satisfied with the battery performance. On Moderate gaming, Moderate Video Content, heavy on calls and heavy on browsing this iPhone 12 battery life is sufficient for your regular Day.
My conclusion is definitely a better and improved battery performer than the previous iPhone model.
Thank you Apple India

3,(PRODUCT)RED,"Extremely disappointed with this phone. It‚Äôs a seemingly average phone which is over priced by 4 to 5 times at least. This phone is a joke in comparison with any Samsung flagship phone. I am shocked that so many fools like me are falling for apple‚Äôs trickery and gimmickry.

The battery doesn‚Äôt last half a day. Screen size is average. Thickness of this phone will constantly remind you that this phone belongs to another era. 64gb space won‚Äôt be enough for anyone.

And then there are other apple quirks - won‚Äôt come with a SD card, won‚Äôt come with a charging brick or a set of head phones. Your headphones with the regular audio pin won‚Äôt work with this one. Face ID won‚Äôt work with masks on. So your forced to remove your masks when you‚Äôre out and vulnerable. This phone won‚Äôt allow you set google maps as default. So you continue to suffer using their apple map which I bet even Tim Cook doesn‚Äôt use. You won‚Äôt be able to set google chrome as your default browser as iOS won‚Äôt let you.

Overall the phone is overpriced and overrated. Anybody with half the wit will figure that this phone is a joke and a mere marketing gimmick. An ordinary phone like this shouldn‚Äôt cost you more than 12 to 14K.

6,Black,"Hello there,
I am writing this review after 3-4 days of usage, Iphone 12 is a beast in terms of:-
Memory
Build quality
Camera
Processor
Display
Except battery there‚Äôs rumour going on that iPhone 12 battery is bad or worst, so i am here to clarify all your doubts,
iPhone battery will last easily a day but not more than that and here‚Äôs some condition that you should aware about
1. If you are using your phone on wifi than it will last a day easily without any problem.
2. If you are on 4g than it will not last a day for example, if you fully charged your phone at 8 am than it will last till 8 pm not more than that and this happen if you‚Äôre on 4g continuously otherwise it will last about 10 pm.
Here‚Äôs some tip you should do after buying iPhone 12, watch video on YouTube to know ‚ÄúHow to save battery on iPhone 12‚Äù this will help you increase your battery life as well battery health.
For my experience, i think you should go for this device without any second thoughts & those who don‚Äôt have any tech knowledge and thinking of buying this then I recommend you to go for android because iOS has complicate settings than android...you will regret after buying it.

I was very much confused between iphone 11 and this one as the price of iphone dropped ... But i am glad i chose this over iphone 11.
1.Display:
Main upgrade in iphone 12 is the oled display. Boy o boy the screen is amazing. I have user many android flagship's but this beats them all.
2.Battery:
Battery is amazing. I am getting 1.5 days of battery life with my usage.
PS: i dont play games.
3.IOS:
This is my 1st iphone and the experience with ios is great ... Very smooth animations ..even though its not 90hz screen but everything is buttery smooth.
4. Camera:
The pics from this phone is superb. FLAGSHIP LEVEL CAMERA! You will not be dissapointed.
5 Build &Design :
This phone looks and feels very premium compared to other phones.Very comfotable to use.
6.Face Id:
Face id works very fast and accurate in low lighting conditions.
7.Updates:
Ios14 is good and we can expect another 4yrs of software updates thats huge !

Cons:
1.Priced very high but it may be because of high taxes and custom duty.
2.No charger and earpods in the box.
3.Notifications are a mess ...android is better in managing new notifications.

8,Blue,"I have been an android user for the past 8+ years. Recently was using iphone 6 for the past few months, liked it much and wanted to switch to ios. I did not want to regret, so i purchased the best in the market, going with iphone 12. Honestly, I dont feel its worthy. Perfomance wise, its good. A lot other phones like MI, 1+ everything gives us a very nice perfomance too. The A14 chip is just a tag line to sell the phone. Are we really going to process million instructions per second on a mobile phone? Defenitely not.

Battery, After charging it to 100% in the morning, I am hardly getting 1 full day with average use. My battery is almost 20% at the end of the day with a screentime of 4-4.3 hours[Update : With low power mode, it makes a 6 hour day, ending with 30%]. Camera quality is amazing in natural light. Yes, as specified it works so nice in night light, but please dont mistake night light as no-light. Front camera is still average. The same things i see in every other mid range android phones. I am still using JIO 4g. Not sure how this would work on 5g (must drain even faster)

Face detenction, the color of the phone, Water resistant and all stuffs are nice to have, fancy items. But not really convinced if this is all we get for 84k?

Fast charging - I bought a 20W charger from apple store for Rs.1900. I plug in when the battery is 20-25% and it takes 1.45 hours to reach 100%. If this is all about fast charging you are looking for, well and good. I never tried with magsafe, honestly. But this to me doesnt seem fast charging for 2800~ mah battery.

I wont say that this phone is too poor. It gives us all that it promises. Personally I dont recommend investing 85k Indian money into this. Either go for lower versions of other iphones like 11 or you can wait for an year and buy this at cheaper cost.

10,Blue,"After thinking a lot, I decided to go ahead with iPhone 12. The original price is ‚Çπ 84900. After credit card discount(‚Çπ6000), old phone exchange(‚Çπ3450) and reward points money(‚Çπ4530) inclusion, I bought it for ‚Çπ70920. There‚Äôs also an additional 3000 discount on red and white variants but I couldn‚Äôt let go of blue

1. PRICE: Considering iPhone 11 would be supported by iOS for 4 years, based on the current price it‚Äôd cost 13k per year and iPhone 12 for 5 years would cost 14.9k(excluding exchange discount) per year. For me price gap for both phones didn‚Äôt seem to make a huge difference as IPhone 11 is already an year old and costing only a 2k less per year.

2: DISPLAY: I‚Äôve purchased iPhone 11 for my mom last year and been observing the display for some months. Compared to iPhone 11, the iPhone 12 display is far superior and has better pixel quality.

3: BEZELS: the bezels of iPhone 12 are much thinner and makes the phone look decent unlike in 11. Apart from this, the phone is incredibly light making it easy to hold it.

How to choose between 64/128gb:
If you‚Äôre not really tight on budget, I‚Äôd suggest to go for 128gb variant. I‚Äôve been using one plus for 1.5 years and storage occupied about 60gb. So it‚Äôd make good sense to check your current phone usage. Either way you can also opt for iCloud 50gb storage which would cost approximately the difference amount of 64 and 128 go for 5 years.

CONS:
1. Could have definitely included the charger for the price
2. If you‚Äôre an android user, migration would be little time consuming

Overall experience of switching to iOS again is so good. The Interface, the speed, smoothness, camera, support, and everything is so well crafter.

19,Black,"I went through a lot of reviews and articles before I decided on the iPhone 12. I‚Äôve been an Android user all my life and frankly thought Apple phones were really overpriced(at least here in India). But in the present day, the flagship Android options are no less expensive.
If you spend a lot of time on your mobile, using it as your primary camera, social media device, business emails/collaboration and also to stream videos then you definitely need to spend a little more and go with a flagship option for the best experience.

Coming to the flagships today (Aug2021), apart from the iPhone we have Samsung Galaxy S21/+/ultra, Oneplus 9 pro, Vivo x60 pro+, mi 11ultra. If you read a few reviews you‚Äôll understand that 888Snapdragon has a lot of heating issues and 9pro cameras didn‚Äôt live up to the hype(also overheating when the camera is in use). Samsung in India ships the phone with exynos2100 which is way less powerful than 888. The prices of all these phones are in the same range (except the ultra). Imp note: iOS updates are across iPhone devices unlike the android updates.

Apple has really done a lot of things right on the iPhone12:

1. They changed its display from lcd to led (huge value jump)
2. A14 Bionic chip is a really fast and smooth without any lag
3. Huge improvement on the primary cameras. Still the best video recording phone in the market and the photos are top quality
4. The change is the body design is really comfortable in the hand
5. The haptics are spot on

What‚Äôs Missing: (Minor misses though)
1. The Notch. Really wish they get rid of the notch but looks like it wont be out until 2023. Anyway you‚Äôll get used to it.
2. USB type C charging. The iPad Pro 2020 model onwards already comes with the TypeC usb charging. I guess the iPhone 13 would get this change
3. Fingerprint Sensor: Yes. Apple had done away with it couple of years back but with the pandemic still on, you sometimes wish there was a fingerprint sensor

Wait for the iPhone 13 or go with the 12:
It took a while for 12‚Äôs prices to fall. If you‚Äôre willing to wait till Feb-March 2022 for a good deal then wait for the 13. If you want to change it now, go with the 12.

64GB or 128GB:
The difference is around ‚Çπ6000. 64GB if you don‚Äôt play too many games and keep dumping the media files every once in while to your pc/storage . Else, the 128üòä

Battery:
I was indeed very surprised with the battery life. Charging time is a little slower compared to it‚Äôs competition but the back up is impressive. It easily lasts a day.

Android Flagship Option:
The truth is, right now is not a good time to purchase an android flagship. If you really want to buy an android flagship, do wait for a while. 895 snapdragon phones are expected to be out by end of the year or early 2022.

Hope this review helped :)

Update:

13 gets a better cam sensor, a15 bionic, 10% bigger battery and a slightly smaller notch. That‚Äôs it. No more differences. Everything else remains the same.

iPhone 13 launched at 80k which is lesser than 12‚Äôs launch price(86k). If you want to save on some cash , 12 will still do the job (12 is currently around 55k-62k). However if you can spend that extra 20k, then 13 should be your pick.

20,Black,"When the iPhone 11 prices were announced, I was in a dilemma whether to go for the 11 or wait for 12. And since it was my first iPhone, I thought why not get the 12. The logic being: The phone will last for a couple of years (provided you don't drop it often), and if you are looking for a phone for a long time horizon, then go for the 12. This one with the better chip and the display will be able to handle the upcoming updates as well the apps which will get even more intensive in the future.
All technical specs are really good, display is an OLED one, even visible in extreme sunlight. Build quality is miles apart, my brother uses a Samsung Galaxy Note 10+, and holding this one is way way out of the leagues of all the android phones. Processor and RAM are capable of even running multiple intensive applications, I had Adobe LightRoom, iMovie, and a couple of apps open, all to slide between them seamlessly. The trick here is that since apps are only made for a very few iPhones and iOS versions, these apps are hardware integrated, hence work better. A classic example is Instagram. Instagram does feel a bit more polished on the iPhone than android. FaceID even works when there's no light, so thats that. But it can't identify you with the mask, you're left to the PIN when you're in the outside.
The Battery: Yes it has a smaller battery, yes with intensive use it will run out in a day, but if you are a bit prudent with it, it'll definitely last for more than a day. I use 4G in between, outdoor photography a bit, editing, email, Apple Music, Youtube, WhatsApp and Instagram. By the end of the day (7:00 PM) , I usually have 40 percent remaining.

21,White,"From owner POV, It's completely different experience for me as I've come from a long line of android platform. But the UI is very attractive. I think it surpassed my expectations as a consumer. But as a rational thinker, 79k is a lot for a phone which carry a little amount of specs ships. I'm lucky that I have a Amazon business account, so getting a GST bill.

As per the limitations :

1. 60 Hz display (with the beautiful UI animations, it doesn't feel like one)
2. Google exceeds on Maps, contacts and AI capabilities.
3. Hefty price tag. (I mean! Wtf is this! 80k! Are you serious?)
4. Necessity of a 1900 INR charger (That too of 20W and without extra cable. Why?)
5. One sillicon case worth 4600 INR ( Sorry! My name's not Sanjib 'Ambani' ! Terrible joke! I know! I left my sarcasm capabilities at an Apple store for leverage.)

Advantages:

1. It's a flagship iPhone 12 with A14 bionic processor and it's best in the market.
2. The UI and the optimization (And I came from an Android background.)
3. Display (Can't find much difference if you're a Samsung flagship user.)
4. The design and in-hand feel.
5. The build quality, you can feel by holding it that it's premium.

Overall, I found it very attractive and worthy of the money spent. (Because I am telling my mind this only as justification for a 80k expenditure)

On a serious note, as coming from an Android background, if Samsung could launch a flagship with Snapdragon latest processor, I could think of buying that.

SECONDLY- why are so many guys reviewing the phone on basis of the charger? everyone knows iphone 12 comes without an adapter. did you people not do your research before buying?
THIRD - the 60 Hz thing does not matter at all, flipping screen is real quick u wont even notice the difference from a 120 Hz in android

Pro Apple
1. Tons of privacy features and solid implementation. Every new app installed needs permission to send notifications.
And with a future update, facebook won't be able to track what you're doing in other apps outside of Facebook. This deserves an applaud.

2. Battery
The battery is amazing, giving more than 6 hours of screen on time. OnePlus can't touch this. If you bring this up with them, they'll distract you by saying it has fast charging.

3. Camera - photos are ok and decent BUT, DAMN, the video quality is amazing. Totally stabilized ready for uploads.

4. Build Quality - SOLID.

5. Continued updates for years and years. An android may last you 2-4 years, and the updated would be ""raam bharose"", but these new iphones especially will easily last 5 years minimum with no compromises on software and security upgrades.

6. Less features, but they work 10/10. Example, auto fill OTP option in keyboard works every single timein iPhone. In Android, if your keyboard is open already before the otp arrives, then this feature won't work. Half baked implementation.

Pro Android / Anti - iOS
1. Notifications. Notifications centre on iPhone SUCKS. I have missed email notifications regularly. Android does this so well.

2. Implementation of new app library feature sucks. This creates a very confusing situation. The way to solve this would be if the auto-folders in app library could be manually managed.

3. Screen Sizes and Notch - The Notch is a disgrace for iphones when the iphones have reached the level of punch hole displays. Hoping the next year's model can make it better.

4. No Truecaller in iPhone and no call recording. I can forgive the call recording considering the privacy first model, but truecaller is a pro to privacy.

5. CHEAP QUALITY OF CHARGING CABLE. For a luxury brand, this is a disgrace.

6. PRICE - Yes, iphones are expensive BUT, paying +10-15k for a phone available cheaper in Dubai / USA really pinches. Damn Taxes.

7. Yes iPhones run smoothly but don't think that these don't stutter. I face very light stutters now and then and I restart at least once a week whenever I encounter it.

Review after 10 months of use.

This pastel green is a treat to the eye

A14 bionic chip is a boss.
Easily compete with 1 year newer snapdragon chips in gaming & thermal management.

Camera ISP of apple are under appreciated

- Video recording performance is unmatched.
(Though there are better androids for still clicks/zoom like pixel & galaxy)

Much lighter than older 11, XR & XS series.. in weight & volume. Easy to grip!

- You don‚Äôt know the pain of owing an iphone until you break it‚Äôs screen. (No experience though xp)
So ceramic-hardened display is a nice add!

Considering iphone 13 are out u can grab 12 at a price drop üòå
If camera is most important, go for 13 eyes closed (much larger physical sensor)

Evaluate Price to value ratio^

Pros :
5nm chip (thermals, efficient)
Face ID (but pain during pandemic)
Good speakers
A14 (only 2 to 3 app on the entire app store that push the gpu to its limit)
OLED (for apple it‚Äôs still a feature lol)
Build to last
Holds value
Lags only once a years (pun intended) üòÇ
Finally good battery life.
Top 99% in silicon & camera among all phones.
5 year OS/security updates
Starting 12 series apple uses Qualcomm modems instead of trash intel ones (good signal)

Cons:
4GB RAM, really apple?
(Supper smooth but doesn't hold when keeping multiple heavy apps open at once)
iOS lacks customisation & consumes a lot of data than android for similar tasks on cellular.
No 120hz
Not price friendly at launch (not gonna make a kidney joke..)
Indian taxes aside apple still exploits pricing.

To sum it up, u will cherish this purchase!
Skip 11 or below‚Ä¶ if not sure hold on till iphone SE 3 with A15 ..might launch in 2022.

31,Blue,"First of all, I don't know why people here are leaving misleading reviews, I didn't feel any sort of heating issue or something like that, neither my phone is damaged nor it is refurbished. These sort of reviews are only making other people sceptical.

Now let's talk about the cell phone itself.
It is great, I love it. The reason why I gave 3 stars is because I have been an android user before this device and I am being honest right now :-

iOS sucks in terms of user experience, Android is easy to use and makes a lot of sense (believe me, I was a hardcore android user, I didn't only use it for playing games and making calls). In iOS I kinda feel like being constraint.

let me give you few example, which are quite obvious but still not in iOS:-
1. Notifications
- You can't reply through notifications.
- Notifications from a similar user/ sender do bundle, but you can only see the latest message (You can't just swipe down on notification to preview the messages)
- if you want to remove a particular notification then you have to swipe two times to the left. If you swiped right then it will open the message for you (lol).
- Notifications are so huge, sometimes it's really painful to scroll through all the notifications.

2. App library
- It has something called app library, they thought it'd be cool to make one but by giving their own flavor. They bundled things in their respective folder not like in android where each icon represent an app. You have to explicitly click on search(app library) to see all apps in the list view or to search an app. Just copy android, no one is slapping you in the face for that.

3. whatsapp
- Using whatsapp is really frustating sometimes.
- To send some media to a contact, there are three processes. Two times it will do preparing and then one time it will do the sending (finally). if you are sending some big media to someone then you can literally get a 15 min power nap and then grab a cup of coffee and drink it, still there might be chances that the iOS would be in one of the preparing process.
- Sometimes when you click on someone's profile then instead of opening the user's profile, whatsapp tends to scroll to the location from where that current day chats are starting (I think that is whatsapp's issue not iOS)
- You can't directly send any media as a document (preserving it's quality). There are steps to do that too.

The above points are few examples, I will keep updating them as per my experience.

I am not saying iOS is slow or the phone's hardware is bad, it's actually quite opposite of bad, it's fast and amazing.
I just hated the user experience domain of iOS. It really really sucks. iOS should bluntly copy the android things so that the HARDCORE IPHONE USERS will know what user experience they were missing.",Reviewed in India on 23 July 2021,Phone is great but iOS sucks,64GB,Verified Purchase

40,Blue,"This is going to be a long review, sit back, relax and have a read.
I bought the iPhone 12 in May of 2021 after selling my OnePlus.
Having used the iPhone7 and XR for years, this was my third iPhone.

I have to say the iOS experience on the XR was absolutely horrible. Terrible reception, average battery and mediocre cameras forced me to move to android. I was tempted to move the 12 for all the improvements in modems, screen and the camera.
And boy was I surprised . Let‚Äôs take up the review in sections.
1. Screen: Having used a high refresh rate screen of OP8 before, I was quite sceptical about the 60hz of iPhone12 before I bought it. But, astonishingly, the iPhone12 screen is buttery smooth, courtesy of the high touch sampling rate and excellent animations. This does not feel like a 60hz display, and I cannot stress this enough. The display is EXCELLENT .

2. Camera: being a photographer who has spent half of his life travelling, I prioritise a good camera over anything else. And these are surely the most spectacular cameras that I have used on a smartphone. Excellent HDR, great details and very post processing friendly. Of course, the video is as good as it gets on a phone. Attaching some images I shot on the 12 for your reference. Trust me when I say this, you could use this for some semi professional shoot just fine, if it‚Äôs only for social media and you are not printing really big.

3. Battery: Battery on this device is not spectacular, it‚Äôs average. It will get you through the day for sure, unless you are in very long video calls two three times a day. It is good enough, on par with my OnePlus.

4. Build Quality: this is where it is head and shoulders above the competition. Rock solid, an led weirdly lightweight, this feels very, very premium.

5. Software: iOS 14 and the iOS15 have really pushed the sub par experience of ios11 away, and this software now feels smoother than ever. Great improvements. Excellent software experience, not something I could say with my XR.

Summary: Excellent device, with no complains. This could really be one of the first devices that I used which I can call perfect. Highly recommended.",Reviewed in India on 27 September 2021,Long Term Review: Excellent All Rounder Device,128GB,Verified Purchase

Which anyways it lasts me for around 1.5 day with normal use and data services and location services always on. Do check the YouTube video to make necessary changes in settings for battery optimisation. Nothing beats the camera performance and let alone the video performance. Phone factor (rectangular edges) feels good to hold however even the MagSafe back cover when put on ruins the fun. Instead try buying a thin screen guard for back of the phone and tempered glass for the front glass as both front and back of the phone seem to be delicate and a costly affair when planning repairs.

45k should have been the right price for 64gb model but for 53k it's not a bad deal either, if you ask me spending 50k for an android is not worth since i phone has all hardware and software superiority.
No charger is a big let down by apple.

65,White,"I used to use an Android phone till 2014 and wanted to switch to iOS, so the same year I bought iPhone 6, It was good to have an iOS device and the performance and the cameras but those were sufficient only until next year when 6s launched. Though I was a fan of the iPhone 5 and 5s box design but couldn't buy them somehow. I wasn't and I'm not crazy about changing or upgrading phone every year so in 2015 I bought again iPhone 6s by having a thought that this phone has everything which I needed ever, except for box design. Now I was satisfied enough with this.
As time goes on and years passed away many iPhone models came but I wasn't eager to buy any of them but when this year series 12 launched, that made me excited to buy because firstly I was technologically behind and secondly the nostalgic box design.
Years ago, when I switched to iOS, I'm quite satisfied with it, I never thought and want to go back to Android.
When it comes to iPhone 12, it's a great and beautiful device. Smooth performance, good battery life, overpriced of course but people always have the choice to buy it or not. Though face ID is new to me and initially little inconvenient compared to touch ID, hopefully, I'm gonna used to of it.

71,Black,"No wonder Apple makes some of the best phones in the world. Iphone 12 deservedly is the highest selling phone.

I was upgrading from iphone 7 which served me well for 4 years, which I exchanged for this.

The delivery & exchange formalities were smooth.

The phone itself is surely an upgrade when compared to 7, the display is top notch, the camera is probably the best there is, the face unlock works like a charm, what's to say about the best phone, it works even better than advertised.

The only problem like always is the battery which hardly lasts a day & charging time is also an issue, it tends to heat up a little while charging but with the previous experience with iphone 7, the longevity of the phone is guaranteed with the timely updates from Apple, the premium which an iphone demands stands justified with a superior product.

Some people tried to discourage me from buying an iphone from Amazon claiming warranty & support issues. But there's no substance to such things. I confirmed the warranty & product registration from Apple, it's as advertised.

Since most of us are going to use it for a longer period of time, it's prudent to opt for the extended warranty offered by Apple which costs around 16500 which gives us an extended year of warranty. Do remember to do this within 3 months of your purchase.",Reviewed in India on 1 June 2021,Best selling phone in the world!!!,128GB,Verified Purchase

75,Green,"Excellent phone, only reason I have reduced one star is since Amazon reduced the price by Rs 3000 the day after I received the phone and this really hurts after spending so much of my hard earned money. Exchange value received for my older phone was also pretty inadequate, considering the condition it was in.

Pros:
1. The green colour is gorgeous
2. Cameras are outstanding
3. Battery life is really good, lasts me almost 2 days on a charge
4. Screen is very bright and has vibrant colours
5. Speaker is very loud

Cons:
1. Just nitpicking, but a fingerprint sensor would have been much more convenient during Covid
2. Indian variant doesn't have the mmWave antenna, inspite of being more expensive than the US Variant

Overall, a great buy.

76,White,"I have been an apple user for the past 10 years and this is the first phone which is disappointing. I was using the Xr and 11 before this and though of upgrading.

1. If you are moving from an android to iPhone for the 1st time, its a great phone to get in terms of camera, processor, screen quality. But if you are already an existing iPhone user, upgrade only from XR downwards. That is if your are upgrading from a 8/X/XS/XR. If you have a 11, stick to it. Wait for the 13 or budget is not a constraint then get the 12 pro.

2. form factor. Apple has gone back to rectangle brick design that they used in their earlier phones. Now for me this was one the reasons I didn't like the phone. It wasn't comfortable n the hand after being used to the curve of the X and 11 and XR

3. Camera- best camera quality with night mode . u can't go wrong with this camera setup.

4. screen- excellent screen quality , no complaints here.

5. 5g - IS it really that big a deal breaker ? especially if you are in India where 5g seems a long way off.

6. No charging adapter. You either have to connect it to your MacBook or buy a separate power adapter. When ur spending 70 odd grand, that's the least apple could offer.

7. again no ear phones.

8. It somehow doesn't have the wow factor as what the X had.

82,Blue,"Yes, it is a 5 star phone. But if you are moving from android to iPhone please be ready to lose your freedom. There is a lot available on internet to tell you about what you will lose out on. It is like speaking a new language altogether.
Quick image editing, video editing, simple things like making collages, setting custom ringtones, quick editing of alarms, changing WiFi or Bluetooth, toggling location, many more basic features are either absent in iOS or managed in a very cumbersome way. You will miss them if moving from Andriod. Also be ready to lose your WhatsApp chat history. Not impressed by the sound reproduction on bigger speakers via Bluetooth and the very inflexible equilizer.
For some silly reasons Apple is being stubborn on some aspects like standardisation of charging cable even within its own products. The notch at the top of the screen is still the same size it was in 2018.

- Stunning design and spectacular OLed display pouring out all the vivid colors
- Smooth app flow and transitions
- Longer battery life 7-8 hrs without automation (best in my usage)
- Camera is just bringing the life out of all the captures you make.

*I am using Apple 20w charger which is insane at charging 20-25 percent in 7 mins. So, In 15 mins, you are having half the battery up. Love the border outlay of this beauty.

Kudos to Apple Inc and Amazon for amazing delivery in 2 days.

*Please avoid playing Apple Arcade games as they would drain you battery like anything. In my best guess, It is not rightly optimised for it.

I have more to add to my earlier review after roughly a month of use. The phone is an original Apple device. It's smooth and quick, and it doesn't become hot when in use or charging. The charge lasts the entire day (I use it mostly for social media, web browsing and music) Face recognition is excellent. Battery health is 100% (check this when you receive your phone under ‚Äòbattery health' in settings) and to keep it that way, make sure you close all background apps while the phone is not in use. Play a ‚Äòpixel test 4K' video on YouTube to see if your phone monitor has any dead pixels. I use the original Apple adaptor (which must be purchased separately) and the type C cable that comes in the box. Overall the phone is a great purchase!",Reviewed in India on 15 July 2021,Excellent!,64GB,Verified Purchase

The display started lagging and and at times the device was completely unresponsive leading to unexpected shutdowns all this happened in merely 5 days of using it. And upon contacting customer support I was informed by Ms. Tuleshwari from support team to connect with Brand and in case the brand is ready to issue a service report they will initiate the replacement request. Upon getting the service report done from Apple service centre the support team staff Mr. Sanjay on outright basis denied replacment stating we cant issue basis the report. It's the brand who will have to be contacted. Customer service and support is clearly lacking with a brand like Amazon. What's the point of claiming of a free 7 day replacement policy when the support team clearly twists it as per their own convenience.

198,Black,"This is the worst apple product I bought so far. After one week of my purchase, I felt the battery is draining fast without any usage. I occasionally use my phones for browsing purposes. Charged to 100% on one evening and switched off for 25 hrs due to fever. After 25 hrs, when I switched on my mobile, the battery is 56%. I am wondering how can I fix it. Disabled all background refresh for apps and did as much as possible to improve the battery life. But no use. I regret to buy this defective product from Apple/amazon",Reviewed in India on 30 January 2022,Worst battery life,64GB,Verified Purchase
